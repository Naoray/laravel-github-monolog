Automatically create GitHub issues from your Laravel exceptions & logs. Perfect for smaller projects without the need for full-featured logging services.

## Requirements

- PHP ^8.3
- Laravel ^11.0|^12.0
- Monolog ^3.6

## Features

- ‚ú® Automatically create GitHub issues from Exceptions & Logs
- üîç Group similar errors into single issues
- üí¨ Add comments to existing issues for recurring errors
- üè∑Ô∏è Support customizable labels
- üéØ Smart deduplication to prevent issue spam
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Buffered logging for better performance
- üìù Customizable issue templates
- üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Tracing Support (Request & User)

## Showcase

When an error occurs in your application, a GitHub issue is automatically created with comprehensive error information and stack trace:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd1a7e9b-e1f3-43ed-b779-14fbaa974916" width="800" alt="issue raised">

The issue appears in your repository with all the detailed information about the error:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fe6e6d7-8ecd-4253-8c05-e8ba2025a536" width="800" alt="issue detail">

If the same error occurs again, instead of creating a duplicate, a new comment is automatically added to track the occurrence:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c76fd583-63a9-49b8-a7fb-a6dcf2c00ee6" width="800" alt="comment added">

## Installation

Install with Composer:

```bash
composer require naoray/laravel-github-monolog
```

## Configuration

Add the GitHub logging channel to `config/logging.php`:

```php
'channels' => [
    // ... other channels ...

    'github' => [
        // Required configuration
        'driver' => 'custom',
        'via' => \Naoray\LaravelGithubMonolog\GithubIssueHandlerFactory::class,
        'repo' => env('GITHUB_REPO'),    // Format: "username/repository"
        'token' => env('GITHUB_TOKEN'),  // Your GitHub Personal Access Token

        // Optional configuration
        'level' => env('LOG_LEVEL', 'error'),
        'labels' => ['bug'],
    ],
]
```

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```
GITHUB_REPO=username/repository
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-personal-access-token
```

You can use the `github` log channel as your default `LOG_CHANNEL` or add it as part of your stack in `LOG_STACK`.

### Getting a GitHub Token

To obtain a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to [Generate a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Laravel%20GitHub%20Issue%20Logger&scopes=repo) (this link pre-selects the required scopes)
2. Review the pre-selected scopes (the `repo` scope should be checked)
3. Click "Generate token"
4. Copy the token immediately (you won't be able to access it again after leaving the page)
5. Add it to your `.env` file as `GITHUB_TOKEN`

> **Note**: The token requires the `repo` scope to create issues in both public and private repositories.

## Usage

Whenever an exception is thrown it will be logged as an issue to your repository.

You can also use it like any other Laravel logging channel:

```php
// Single channel
Log::channel('github')->error('Something went wrong!');

// Or as part of a stack
Log::stack(['daily', 'github'])->error('Something went wrong!');
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Templates

The package uses Markdown templates to format issues and comments. You can customize these templates by publishing them:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="github-monolog-views"
```

This will copy the templates to `resources/views/vendor/github-monolog/` where you can modify them:

- `issue.md`: Template for new issues
- `comment.md`: Template for comments on existing issues
- `previous_exception.md`: Template for previous exceptions in the chain

> **Important**: The templates use HTML comments as section markers (e.g. `<!-- stacktrace:start -->` and `<!-- stacktrace:end -->`). These markers are used to intelligently remove empty sections from the rendered output. Please keep these markers intact when customizing the templates.

Available template variables:
- `{level}`: Log level (error, warning, etc.)
- `{message}`: The error message or log content
- `{simplified_stack_trace}`: A cleaned up stack trace
- `{full_stack_trace}`: The complete stack trace
- `{previous_exceptions}`: Details of any previous exceptions
- `{context}`: Additional context data
- `{extra}`: Extra log data
- `{signature}`: Internal signature used for deduplication

### Deduplication

Group similar errors to avoid duplicate issues. The package uses Laravel's cache system for deduplication storage.

```php
'github' => [
    // ... basic config from above ...
    'deduplication' => [
        'time' => 60,        // Time window in seconds - how long to wait before creating a new issue
        'store' => null,     // Uses your default cache store (from cache.default)
        'prefix' => 'dedup', // Prefix for cache keys
    ],
]
```

For cache store configuration, refer to the [Laravel Cache documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/cache).

### Buffering

Buffer logs to reduce GitHub API calls. Customize the buffer size and overflow behavior to optimize performance:

```php
'github' => [
    // ... basic config from above ...
    'buffer' => [
        'limit' => 0,        // Maximum records in buffer (0 = unlimited, flush on shutdown)
        'flush_on_overflow' => true,  // When limit is reached: true = flush all, false = remove oldest
    ],
]
```

When buffering is active:
- Logs are collected in memory until flushed
- Buffer is automatically flushed on application shutdown
- When limit is reached:
  - With `flush_on_overflow = true`: All records are flushed
  - With `flush_on_overflow = false`: Only the oldest record is removed

### Tracing

The package includes optional tracing capabilities that allow you to track requests and user data in your logs. Enable this feature through your configuration:

```php
'tracing' => [
    'enabled' => true,    // Master switch for all tracing
    'requests' => true,   // Enable request tracing
    'user' => true,      // Enable user tracing
]
```

#### Request Tracing
When request tracing is enabled, the following data is automatically logged:
- URL
- HTTP Method
- Route information
- Headers (filtered to remove sensitive data)
- Request body

#### User Tracing
By default, user tracing only logs the user identifier to comply with GDPR regulations. However, you can customize the user data being logged by setting your own resolver:

```php
use Naoray\LaravelGithubMonolog\Tracing\UserDataCollector;

UserDataCollector::setUserDataResolver(function ($user) {
    return [
        'username' => $user->username,
        // Add any other user fields you want to log
    ];
});
```

> **Note:** When customizing user data collection, ensure you comply with relevant privacy regulations and only collect necessary information.

### Signature Generator

Control how errors are grouped by customizing the signature generator. By default, the package uses a generator that creates signatures based on exception details or log message content.

```php
'github' => [
    // ... basic config from above ...
    'signature_generator' => \Naoray\LaravelGithubMonolog\Deduplication\DefaultSignatureGenerator::class,
]
```

You can implement your own signature generator by implementing the `SignatureGeneratorInterface`:

```php
use Monolog\LogRecord;
use Naoray\LaravelGithubMonolog\Deduplication\SignatureGeneratorInterface;

class CustomSignatureGenerator implements SignatureGeneratorInterface
{
    public function generate(LogRecord $record): string
    {
        // Your custom logic to generate a signature
        return md5($record->message);
    }
}
```
