Automatically create GitHub issues from your Laravel logs. Perfect for smaller projects without the need for full-featured logging services.

## Requirements

- PHP ^8.3
- Laravel ^11.0
- Monolog ^3.6

## Features

- ‚ú® Automatically create GitHub issues from logs
- üîç Group similar errors into single issues
- üí¨ Add comments to existing issues for recurring errors
- üè∑Ô∏è Support customizable labels
- üéØ Smart deduplication to prevent issue spam
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Buffered logging for better performance

## Showcase

When an error occurs in your application, a GitHub issue is automatically created with comprehensive error information and stack trace:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd1a7e9b-e1f3-43ed-b779-14fbaa974916" width="800" alt="issue raised">

The issue appears in your repository with all the detailed information about the error:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fe6e6d7-8ecd-4253-8c05-e8ba2025a536" width="800" alt="issue detail">

If the same error occurs again, instead of creating a duplicate, a new comment is automatically added to track the occurrence:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c76fd583-63a9-49b8-a7fb-a6dcf2c00ee6" width="800" alt="comment added">

## Installation

Install with Composer:

```bash
composer require naoray/laravel-github-monolog
```

## Configuration

Add the GitHub logging channel to `config/logging.php`:

```php
'channels' => [
    // ... other channels ...

    'github' => [
        // Required configuration
        'driver' => 'custom',
        'via' => \Naoray\LaravelGithubMonolog\GithubIssueHandlerFactory::class,
        'repo' => env('GITHUB_REPO'),    // Format: "username/repository"
        'token' => env('GITHUB_TOKEN'),  // Your GitHub Personal Access Token

        // Optional configuration
        'level' => env('LOG_LEVEL', 'error'),
        'labels' => ['bug'],
    ],
]
```

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```
GITHUB_REPO=username/repository
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-personal-access-token
```

You can use the `github` log channel as your default `LOG_CHANNEL` or add it as part of your stack in `LOG_STACK`.

### Advanced Configuration

Deduplication and buffering are enabled by default to enhance logging. Customize these features to suit your needs.

#### Deduplication

Group similar errors to avoid duplicate issues. By default, the package uses file-based storage. Customize the storage and time window to fit your application.

```php
'github' => [
    // ... basic config from above ...
    'deduplication' => [
        'store' => 'file',  // Default store
        'time' => 60,       // Time window in seconds
    ],
]
```

##### Alternative Storage Options

Consider other storage options in these Laravel-specific scenarios:

- **Redis Store**: Use when:
  - Running async queue jobs (file storage won't work across processes)
  - Using Laravel Horizon for queue management
  - Running multiple application instances behind a load balancer
  ```php
  'deduplication' => [
      'store' => 'redis',
      'prefix' => 'github-monolog:',
      'connection' => 'default',  // Uses your Laravel Redis connection
  ],
  ```

- **Database Store**: Use when:
  - Running queue jobs but Redis isn't available
  - Need to persist deduplication data across deployments
  - Want to query/debug deduplication history via database
  ```php
  'deduplication' => [
      'store' => 'database',
      'table' => 'github_monolog_deduplication',
      'connection' => null,  // Uses your default database connection
  ],
  ```

#### Buffering

Buffer logs to reduce GitHub API calls. Customize the buffer size and overflow behavior to optimize performance:

```php
'github' => [
    // ... basic config from above ...
    'buffer' => [
        'limit' => 0,        // Maximum records in buffer (0 = unlimited, flush on shutdown)
        'flush_on_overflow' => true,  // When limit is reached: true = flush all, false = remove oldest
    ],
]
```

When buffering is active:
- Logs are collected in memory until flushed
- Buffer is automatically flushed on application shutdown
- When limit is reached:
  - With `flush_on_overflow = true`: All records are flushed
  - With `flush_on_overflow = false`: Only the oldest record is removed

### Getting a GitHub Token

To obtain a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to [Generate a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Laravel%20GitHub%20Issue%20Logger&scopes=repo) (this link pre-selects the required scopes)
2. Review the pre-selected scopes (the `repo` scope should be checked)
3. Click "Generate token"
4. Copy the token immediately (you won't be able to access it again after leaving the page)
5. Add it to your `.env` file as `GITHUB_TOKEN`

> **Note**: The token requires the `repo` scope to create issues in both public and private repositories.

## Usage

Whenever an exception is thrown it will be logged as an issue to your repository.

You can also use it like any other Laravel logging channel:

```php
// Single channel
Log::channel('github')->error('Something went wrong!');

// Or as part of a stack
Log::stack(['daily', 'github'])->error('Something went wrong!');
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
